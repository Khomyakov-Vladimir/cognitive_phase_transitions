abstract: |
  This article investigates cognitive phase transitions within the framework of Subjective Physics, providing direct computational evidence of a critical transition in an adaptive network of $N=40$ cognitive agents. We explicitly distinguish between the global order parameter $|\langle\psi\rangle|$ (Kuramoto mean-field amplitude) and the Mean Pairwise Coherence (MPC), a measure of local synchronization. A clear non-monotonic transition was detected at control parameter $r_c = \num{1.534}$, characterized by a sharp change ($|\Delta\text{MPC}|=\num{0.133}$) indicating a structural reorganization of the system's synchronized clusters. Following a transient period of desynchronization (MPC minimum $\sim\num{0.42}$), the system stabilizes into a high-coherence phase (post-transition $\text{MPC} = \num{0.992} \pm \num{0.007}$). The results demonstrate a phenomenology analogous to second-order phase transitions in physical systems, confirming key hypotheses of Subjective Physics regarding the reorganization of observer states.
